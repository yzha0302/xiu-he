# ⚔️ Quests (Active Bounties & Tasks)

## 📌 Overview
The **Task Execution Layer**. This directory manages active "Quests" - external projects, side-missions, and bounty tasks that are currently in progress.

## 🗂 Structure
*   **`Bounties/`**: Paid or high-value external tasks (e.g., freelance work, specific deliverables).
*   **`Power_Leveling/`**: Personal growth challenges or skill-grinding projects (e.g., "Roommate Dispute Resolution" was a Leveling Quest).
*   **`Side_Quests/`**: Smaller, low-priority, or experimental tasks.

## 🔒 Privacy Policy
**STATUS: LOCAL ONLY**
Contents are **git-ignored** because active quests often contain:
1.  **Client Data**: NDAs and private specs.
2.  **Live State**: messy, rapidly changing files.
3.  **Personal Details**: Real-world interactions (like housing disputes).
