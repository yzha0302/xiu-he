Vibe Kanban provides comprehensive keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate and interact with the application efficiently. These shortcuts are organised by scope and context.

## Platform Keys

- **⌘** = Mac Command key
- **Ctrl** = Windows/Linux Control key

## Global Shortcuts

These shortcuts work anywhere in the application (unless you're typing in an input field):

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `C` | Create Task | Opens the Task Form dialog to create a new task |
| `⌘/Ctrl + S` | Focus Search | Puts keyboard focus into the global search input |

## Board Navigation

These shortcuts work when a task card is highlighted with the blue focus ring:

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `k` / `j` | Vertical Navigation | Move focus up/down within the current column |
| `h` / `l` | Horizontal Navigation | Move focus to first task in previous/next non-empty column |
| `Enter` | Open Task | Open the Task Details panel for the focused task |
| `d` | Delete Task | Delete the currently focused task |

## Form Submission

These shortcuts work in various forms and dialogs:

| Shortcut | Action | Context |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `⌘/Ctrl + Enter` | Submit | Create & Start (Task Form), Save (Template Editor) |
| `⌘/Ctrl + Enter` | Send Message | Send message to coding agent in task interface |
| `⌘/Ctrl + Enter` | Save Comment | Add or save comment in Diff Review |
| `Enter` | New Line | Create new line in message field |
| `Shift + Tab` | Switch Agent Profile | Switch between agent profiles (e.g., PLAN to DEFAULT) |
| `Escape` | Cancel/Clear | Clear draft in follow-up, cancel comment editing |

## Search

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `⌘/Ctrl + S` | Focus Search | Move cursor to the search input field |
| `Escape` | Clear Search | Clear search text and remove focus (when in search field) |

*Note: The search field displays a "⌘S" badge to help you discover this shortcut.*

## Tips

- **Focus Indicators**: Look for blue focus rings around task cards to know when board navigation shortcuts are active
- **Input Fields**: Global shortcuts are disabled when typing in text fields to avoid conflicts
- **Visual Cues**: Some shortcuts display badges or hints in the interface (like the "⌘S" next to search)
- **Modifier Keys**: Global shortcuts are disabled when holding Ctrl/⌘/Alt unless the shortcut specifically uses those modifiers
