## Agent Reports Empty Codebase

If your coding agent reports that the codebase is empty when you create a new task, you may have Git's sparse-checkout feature enabled in your repository.

**Solution:**

Run the following command in the root directory of your repository:

```bash
git sparse-checkout disable
```

After disabling sparse-checkout, create a new task and try again.

## Enabling Debug Logs

If you need more detailed logs to help debug an issue, you can enable debug-level logging by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.

**Usage:**

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug npx vibe-kanban
```

This will provide verbose logging output that can help identify the root cause of issues.

## DANGER: Wiping Your Database 

If you encounter irrecoverable errors and need to completely wipe your Vibe Kanban database, you can delete the application data directory for your operating system. 

<Warning>
This action is irreversible and will result in the loss of ALL your tasks and settings. Make sure to back up any important information before proceeding.
</Warning>

**Delete the following directory based on your OS:**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS">
```bash
~/Library/Application Support/ai.bloop.vibe-kanban/
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Linux">
```bash
~/.local/share/vibe-kanban/
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">
```
%APPDATA%\bloop\vibe-kanban\
```

Typically: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\bloop\vibe-kanban\`
</Tab>
</Tabs>

After deleting the application data directory, restart Vibe Kanban to reset with an empty database and default settings.
