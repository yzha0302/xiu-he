## Command Bar Navigation

The command bar organises commands into pages:

1. **Root** - Quick actions and navigation to other pages
2. **Workspace Actions** - Workspace management commands
3. **Git Actions** - Version control operations
4. **View Options** - Panel visibility toggles
5. **Diff Options** - Diff viewer settings
6. **Repo Actions** - Per-repository commands (multi-repo workspaces)

Use the search field to filter commands across all pages, or navigate to specific pages for categorised access.

<Info>
Start typing to search for any command. The command bar uses fuzzy matching, so you don't need to type the exact command name.
