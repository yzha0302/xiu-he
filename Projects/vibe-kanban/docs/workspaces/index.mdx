The Workspaces UI is a complete redesign of the task execution experience, providing an IDE-like interface optimised for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Workspace** | A task execution environment where you work with agents | "Add user authentication" |
| **Repository** | A git repository included in a workspace | `frontend`, `backend` |
| **Session** | A conversation thread with a coding agent | Claude Code session for implementing a feature |

**How they relate:**
- A **workspace** is your working environment for a specific task
- A workspace can contain one or more **repositories** (each with independent git state)
- Within a workspace, you can have multiple **sessions** to chat with different agents or start fresh conversations

For example, you create a workspace for "Add authentication" that includes both `frontend` and `backend` repositories. Within that workspace, you might have one session for implementing the backend API and another session for the frontend UI.
