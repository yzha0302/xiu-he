Workspaces support working across multiple repositories and running multiple agent sessions simultaneously.

## Multi-Repository Support

Add multiple repositories to a single workspace to work on cross-repo tasks.

### Adding Repositories

</Frame>

When creating a new workspace, add multiple repositories from the create view:

1. Click the **+** button in the workspace sidebar
2. Select your **project** from the dropdown
3. Click repositories from the **Add Repositories** list to include them
4. Set the **target branch** for each selected repository
5. Each repo maintains independent git state

### Working Across Repos

With multiple repositories in a workspace:

- **Reference code** from one repo while implementing changes in another
- **Implement coordinated changes** across multiple codebases
- **Manage git operations** independently per repository
- **View changes** from all repos in a unified diff view

### Repository Panel

Each repository in the workspace shows:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Repository name | With status indicator |
| Current branch | The working branch |
| Target branch | Branch to merge into |
| Changes count | Uncommitted modifications |
| Commits ahead/behind | Relative to target branch |

### Per-Repository Actions

Access repository-specific actions via the [command bar](/workspaces/command-bar):

- **Open Repo in IDE** - Open just this repository
- **Copy Repo Path** - Copy the repository path
- **Repository Settings** - Configure repo options
- **Git Operations** - PR, merge, rebase per repo

<Tip>
Use the command bar's Repo Actions page to quickly switch between repositories when performing git operations.
</Tip>

## Multiple Sessions

Create multiple agent conversation sessions within a single workspace.

### Why Use Multiple Sessions?

- **Token limits**: Start fresh sessions when conversations get long
- **Parallel work**: Run different tasks or agents simultaneously
- **Code review**: Start a dedicated review session
- **Experimentation**: Try different approaches in separate sessions

### Creating a New Session

1. Click the session dropdown in the chat box toolbar
2. Select **New Session** from the dropdown
3. Select the agent to use for the new session
4. Start your conversation

### Switching Between Sessions

The session dropdown in the chat box toolbar shows all sessions:

- **Latest** - the most recent session
- Older sessions show their creation timestamp
- Click any session to switch to it
- Each session maintains its own conversation history

### Session Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Running** | Agent is actively processing |
| **Idle** | Session waiting for input |
| **Agent icon** | Shows which agent is assigned |

### Running Multiple Agents

Different sessions can use different coding agents:

1. Create a new session
2. Select a different agent (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)
3. Both sessions can run in parallel
4. Switch between them to monitor progress

<Info>
Each session operates independently. Changes made by one agent are visible to other sessions through the shared workspace files.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### Multi-Repo Workflows

- **Start with a plan**: Describe the cross-repo changes needed upfront
- **Coordinate commits**: Ensure related changes are committed together
- **Test integration**: Use the preview to verify repos work together
- **Create linked PRs**: Reference related PRs across repositories

### Session Management

- **Name sessions descriptively**: Use the rename feature to identify session purposes
- **Archive completed sessions**: Keep the session list manageable
- **Use review sessions**: Dedicate sessions for code review feedback
- **Limit concurrent sessions**: Too many active sessions can be confusing

<Warning>
Be mindful of file conflicts when multiple sessions modify the same files. Review changes carefully before committing.
</Warning>
