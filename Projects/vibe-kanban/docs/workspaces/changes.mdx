The changes panel lets you review all code modifications in your workspace and provide feedback to agents.

## Opening Changes

- Click the **Changes** toggle (<Icon icon="code-compare" />) in the navbar
- Click the changes icon in the context bar
- Use the command bar: `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Toggle Changes Panel"

## File Tree

The changes panel displays a hierarchical file tree:

- **Folders**: Expand/collapse to navigate
- **Files**: Click to view the diff
- **Search**: Filter files by name
- **Expand/Collapse All**: Quick navigation buttons

## Diff Viewer

View code changes with syntax highlighting:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Additions** | Green highlighting for new lines |
| **Deletions** | Red highlighting for removed lines |
| **Context** | Surrounding unchanged lines for reference |
| **Line numbers** | Original and new line numbers |

## Diff View Modes

Toggle between two display modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Unified** | Inline view with changes interleaved |
| **Side-by-Side** | Original and modified shown in parallel columns |

Switch modes using the diff view toggle in the navbar (when Changes panel is open) or via command bar: `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Toggle Diff View Mode".

## Diff Options

Customise the diff display:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Wrap Lines** | Enable/disable line wrapping for long lines |
| **Ignore Whitespace** | Show/hide whitespace-only changes |
| **Expand All** | Expand all collapsed diff sections |
| **Collapse All** | Collapse all diff sections |

Access these via the command bar's Diff Options page.

## Giving Feedback with Comments

</Frame>

Add comments directly on code changes to provide feedback to agents.

### Adding Comments

1. Hover over a line in the diff
2. Click the comment icon that appears
3. Write your feedback
4. Submit the comment

### Comment Uses

- **Request changes**: Ask the agent to modify specific code
- **Ask questions**: Get explanations about implementation choices
- **Provide context**: Share additional requirements or constraints
- **Approve sections**: Indicate code that looks good

### Agent Response to Comments

</Frame>

When you send a message with review comments, the agent sees your feedback and acts on it. In this example, the agent restores a file after the user requested the change be reverted.

<Info>
Comments are visible to the agent in subsequent messages, helping guide further development.

## GitHub Integration

When your workspace is linked to a pull request:

### Viewing GitHub Comments

</Frame>

- Click the **GitHub icon** in the changes panel toolbar to toggle GitHub comments
- Comments from the PR appear inline with the diff
- Badge shows comment count per file

</Frame>

<Note>
Only submitted review comments are shown. Pending reviews (not yet submitted on GitHub) won't appear until you submit the review.
</Note>

### Linking to a PR

Workspaces automatically link when:

- You create a PR from the workspace
- The workspace branch matches an existing PR

<Tip>
Review GitHub comments alongside your changes to address PR feedback efficiently.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

1. Open the changes panel after the agent completes work
2. Review diffs file by file
3. Add comments for any needed changes
4. Let the agent address feedback
5. Re-review and approve
