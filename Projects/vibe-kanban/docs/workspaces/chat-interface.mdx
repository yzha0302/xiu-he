## Approval Workflow

When an agent needs approval before proceeding, you'll see an approval card:

### Reviewing Plans

2. Review the plan details (expand to see full content)
3. Choose to **Approve** or **Request Changes**

### Requesting Changes

If you want modifications:

1. Type your feedback in the chat input

<Note>
Approval requests have a timeout. If you don't respond, you may need to restart the task.

## Status Indicators

### Token Usage

<Frame>
<img src="/images/workspaces-token-usage.png" alt="Context gauge showing 13% usage with 27K of 200K tokens used" />
</Frame>

The context gauge shows how much of the agent's context window is used:

| Colour | Usage Level |
|--------|-------------|
| Grey | Low usage |
| Default | Normal usage |
| Orange | High usage - consider starting a new session |
| Red | Critical - near context limit |

<Tip>
When context usage is high, start a new session to give the agent fresh context.
</Tip>

### Tasks Progress
