Repositories are the codebases you work with inside a workspace. Each workspace can include one or more repositories, and each repository maintains its own independent git state.

## Adding Repositories

When creating or editing a workspace, you can add repositories from several sources:

### Recent Repositories

<Frame>

</Frame>

Your recently used repositories appear at the top of the list. Click any repository to add it to the workspace.

### Browse Repos on Disk

<Frame>

</Frame>

Click **Browse repos on disk** to find repositories that aren't in your recent list. You can:

- **Enter path manually** - Type the full path and click **Go**
- **Search current directory** - Filter folders by name
- **Navigate folders** - Click folder names to browse, use home and up buttons
- **Select Current** - Use the current directory as the repository

Folders containing git repositories are marked with a **git repo** badge.

### Create New Repo on Disk

<Frame>

</Frame>

Click **Create new repo on disk** to initialise a new git repository:

1. Enter a **Name** for the repository
2. Choose a **Location** on disk (click the folder icon to browse)
3. Click **Create Repository**

This creates a new folder with an initialised git repository, ready for use in your workspace.

## Target Branches

<Frame>

</Frame>

Each repository in a workspace has a **target branch** - the branch your changes will eventually be merged into (typically `main`, `master`, or `develop`).

### Setting the Target Branch

1. Click the branch dropdown next to the repository name
2. Search or scroll to find the branch you want to target
3. Select the branch - the workspace creates a working branch based on this target

The dropdown shows:
- **Current** badge - indicates your current branch
- **Local branches** - branches on your machine
- **Remote branches** - branches from origin (e.g., `origin/main`)

<Info>
Changes you make won't affect the target branch until you create a pull request and merge.
</Info>

### Changing the Target Branch

To change the target branch after workspace creation:

**From the Git panel:**
1. Click the target branch dropdown (e.g., **main**) in the Git section of the right sidebar
2. Select a new target branch

**From the command bar:**
1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
2. Select **Change Target Branch**
3. Choose the new target branch

<Warning>
Changing the target branch may require rebasing your changes. See [Resolving Rebase Conflicts](/core-features/resolving-rebase-conflicts) if conflicts occur.
</Warning>

## Working Branch

When you create a workspace, a **working branch** is automatically created for each repository. This is where your changes are made.

The working branch name is based on your task and branch prefix settings (configured in [Global Settings](/configuration-customisation/global-settings)).

### Viewing the Working Branch

The current working branch is displayed in the **Git** section of the details sidebar, under "Working Branch".

## Multi-Repository Workspaces

<Frame>

</Frame>

Workspaces can include multiple repositories for tasks that span several codebases.

### When to Use Multiple Repositories

- **Monorepo alternatives** - Work across frontend and backend repos simultaneously
- **Shared libraries** - Update a library and its consumers together
- **Microservices** - Coordinate changes across multiple services

### Independent Git State

Each repository in a multi-repo workspace maintains independent git state:

- Separate working branches
- Separate target branches
- Individual commit histories
- Independent pull requests

### Cross-Repository Context

When working with multiple repositories, the agent can:

- Read code from all repositories
- Make changes across repositories in a single session
- Reference patterns from one repo while implementing in another

<Tip>
Use clear task descriptions that specify which repositories should be modified to help the agent understand your intent.
</Tip>

## Repository Actions

Access repository-specific actions through the command bar:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Copy Repo Path** | Copy the repository's local path to clipboard |
| **Open Repo in IDE** | Open the repository in your configured editor |
| **Repository Settings** | Configure repository-specific settings |
| **Create PR** | Create a pull request for this repository |
| **Merge** | Merge the target branch into your working branch |
| **Rebase** | Rebase your working branch onto the target |
| **Push** | Push commits to the remote repository |

<Note>
For multi-repo workspaces, repository actions show which repo they apply to. Select the specific repository when prompted.
</Note>

## Removing Repositories

<Frame>

</Frame>

To remove a repository from a workspace, click the **X** button next to the repository name.

<Warning>
Removing a repository doesn't delete any code or branches. It only removes the repository from the current workspace.
</Warning>
