## Supported Systems

We build and test Vibe Kanban on the following systems:

- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux
- Windows

## Prerequisites

Before installing Vibe Kanban, ensure you have:

- **Node.js**: Latest LTS version recommended
- **Coding agent authentication**: Authenticate with your preferred coding agents outside of Vibe Kanban

## Safety Notice

<Warning>
Vibe Kanban runs AI agents with --dangerously-skip-permissions/--yolo flags by default so they can work autonomously without constant approval prompts. Each task runs in an isolated git worktree, preventing agents from interfering with each other.
Agents can still perform system-level actions, so review their work and keep backups.
</Warning>

## Installation & Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Authenticate with a coding agent">
  Before launching Vibe Kanban, ensure you're authenticated with at least one [supported coding agent](/supported-coding-agents). Follow the installation and authentication instructions for your preferred agent.
</Step>

<Step title="Install and launch Vibe Kanban">
  Open a terminal and run:

  ```bash
  npx vibe-kanban
  ```

  <Check>
  The application will bind to a random free port, print the URL in the terminal, and automatically open in your default browser.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Complete initial setup">
  Complete the setup dialogs to configure your coding agent and editor preferences. GitHub integration relies on the GitHub CLI and is configured when needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Create your first project">
  You'll land on the Projects page, populated with your three most recently active git projects if automatically discovered. Click "Create project" to add more projects.
</Step>

<Step title="Add tasks">
  Start tracking your work by [creating tasks](/core-features/creating-tasks) within your project.
</Step>

<Step title="Optional: GitHub integration">
  Vibe Kanban uses the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) for creating pull requests. Ensure `gh` is installed and authenticated on your system, or follow the setup prompts when creating your first pull request.
</Step>

<Step title="Optional: Set up MCP integration">
  Streamline task creation with coding agents by [setting up MCP integration](/integrations/vibe-kanban-mcp-server).
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
To use a fixed port, specify the `PORT` environment variable: `PORT=8080 npx vibe-kanban`
