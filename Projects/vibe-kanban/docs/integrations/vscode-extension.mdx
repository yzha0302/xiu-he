## Installation

<Tabs>
<Tab title="VSCode">
Install directly from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace:

<Card title="VSCode Marketplace" icon="download" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bloop.vibe-kanban">
  Install the official Vibe Kanban extension for VSCode
</Card>

Alternatively, search for the extension ID in VSCode:
1. Open VSCode
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS) to open Extensions
3. Search for `@id:bloop.vibe-kanban`
4. Click **Install**
</Tab>

<Tab title="Cursor">
For Cursor, use the Open VSX Registry:

<Card title="Open VSX Registry" icon="download" href="https://open-vsx.org/extension/bloop/vibe-kanban">
  Install from Open VSX for Cursor compatibility
</Card>

<Tip>
Since deeplinking from Open VSX doesn't work reliably in Cursor, the easiest installation method is searching by extension ID within the IDE.
</Tip>

**Installation Steps**:
1. Open Cursor
2. Open the Extensions panel
3. Search for `@id:bloop.vibe-kanban`
4. Install the extension
</Tab>

<Tab title="Windsurf">
For Windsurf, use the Open VSX Registry:

<Card title="Open VSX Registry" icon="download" href="https://open-vsx.org/extension/bloop/vibe-kanban">
  Install from Open VSX for Windsurf compatibility
</Card>

<Tip>
Since deeplinking from Open VSX doesn't work reliably in Windsurf, the easiest installation method is searching by extension ID within the IDE.
</Tip>

**Installation Steps**:
1. Open Windsurf
2. Open the Extensions panel
3. Search for `@id:bloop.vibe-kanban`
4. Install the extension
</Tab>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Empty Extension UI

**Problem**: The extension UI appears empty or shows no task information.

**Solution**: Ensure you're working within a worktree created by a Vibe Kanban task.

<Warning>
The extension can only display task information when VSCode is opened in a directory that corresponds to an active Vibe Kanban task worktree.
</Warning>

**Steps to resolve**:
1. Verify you opened VSCode through the "Open in [IDE]" button from a Vibe Kanban task
2. Check that you're in the correct directory/worktree
3. If the issue persists, restart your IDE and try the workflow again

### Extension Not Loading

**Problem**: The Vibe Kanban extension doesn't appear in your IDE.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the extension is installed by searching `@id:bloop.vibe-kanban` in Extensions
- Restart your IDE after installation
- Check that you're using a compatible IDE version
- For Cursor/Windsurf users, ensure you installed from Open VSX Registry

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Workflow Optimization**: Always start tasks from the Vibe Kanban web interface before opening in your IDE to ensure proper context and worktree setup.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Performance**: Close unused IDE windows to reduce resource usage.
</Tip>
