Vibe Kanban integrates with GitHub to let you create pull requests directly from your task attempts. This integration relies on the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) being installed and authenticated on your system.

## Setup

There is no need to configure GitHub in the Vibe Kanban settings manually. The integration is designed to work out-of-the-box if you have the GitHub CLI installed.

### Automatic Setup
When you attempt to create your first Pull Request, Vibe Kanban will check if the GitHub CLI is available. If it's not found or not authenticated, you will be guided through the setup process:

1.  **On macOS**: You will see a dialog offering to install the GitHub CLI via Homebrew automatically.
2.  **On Windows/Linux**: You will be provided with instructions to install the CLI manually.

### Manual Setup
You can also set up the integration manually in your terminal before using Vibe Kanban:

1.  **Install GitHub CLI**: Follow the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) for your operating system.
2.  **Authenticate**: Run the following command in your terminal and follow the prompts:
    ```bash
    gh auth login
    ```
    Select **GitHub.com**, choose **HTTPS** or **SSH** as your preferred protocol, and complete the login via the web browser.

## Creating a Pull Request

Once the GitHub CLI is ready, you can create pull requests directly from a task:

1.  Open a task that has changes you want to merge.
2.  Click the **Create PR** button.
3.  A dialog will appear pre-filled with:
    *   **Title**: Derived from the task title.
    *   **Description**: Derived from the task description.
    *   **Base Branch**: The target branch for your changes (defaults to the repository's default branch or the one specified in the attempt).
4.  Click **Create** to open the PR on GitHub.

If the operation is successful, the task status will update, and a link to the new Pull Request will be available.
