Vibe Kanban integrates with Azure Repos to let you create pull requests directly from your task attempts. This integration relies on the [Azure CLI (`az`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) with the Azure DevOps extension being installed and authenticated on your system.

## Setup

Before you can create pull requests from Vibe Kanban, you need to install and configure the Azure CLI manually.

### Install Azure CLI

Follow the [official installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) for your operating system:

- **macOS**: `brew install azure-cli`
- **Windows**: Download and run the MSI installer from the Azure CLI documentation
- **Linux**: Use your distribution's package manager or the install script

### Install the Azure DevOps Extension

The Azure DevOps extension adds repository and pull request commands to the Azure CLI. Run the following command:

```bash
az extension add --name azure-devops
```

### Authenticate

1.  **Sign in to Azure**: Run the following command and follow the prompts to authenticate via the web browser:
    ```bash
    az login
    ```

2.  **Configure defaults** (optional but recommended): Set your default organisation and project to avoid specifying them with each command:
    ```bash
    az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/{your-org} project={your-project}
    ```

## Supported URL Formats

Vibe Kanban supports both modern and legacy Azure DevOps URL formats:

- **Modern**: `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_git/{repo}`
- **Legacy**: `https://{org}.visualstudio.com/{project}/_git/{repo}`

Both HTTPS and SSH remote URLs are supported.

## Creating a Pull Request

Once the Azure CLI is ready, you can create pull requests directly from a task:

1.  Open a task that has changes you want to merge.
2.  Click the **Create PR** button.
3.  A dialog will appear pre-filled with:
    *   **Title**: Derived from the task title.
    *   **Description**: Derived from the task description.
    *   **Base Branch**: The target branch for your changes (defaults to the repository's default branch or the one specified in the attempt).
4.  Click **Create** to open the PR on Azure Repos.

If the operation is successful, the task status will update, and a link to the new Pull Request will be available.
