//! Shape definitions for realtime streaming.
//!
//! This module provides the core shape infrastructure:
//! - `ShapeDefinition<T>` struct for shape metadata
//! - `ShapeExport` trait for heterogeneous shape collections
//! - `define_shape!` macro for compile-time SQL validation
//!
//! The `define_entity!` macro in the `entity` module uses `define_shape!` internally.
//! Shape constants are re-exported from the `entities` module for convenience.

/// Macro to define shapes with compile-time SQL validation.

/// The macro validates SQL at compile time using `sqlx::query!`, ensuring that:
/// - The table exists
/// - The columns in the WHERE clause exist
/// - The SQL syntax is correct
///
/// **Note**: Prefer using `define_entity!` from the `entity` module, which generates
/// both shape and mutation types from a single declaration.
///
/// Usage:
/// ```ignore
/// define_shape!(
///     PROJECTS, Project,
///     table: "projects",
///     where_clause: r#""organization_id" = $1"#,
///     url: "/shape/projects",
///     params: ["organization_id"]
/// );
