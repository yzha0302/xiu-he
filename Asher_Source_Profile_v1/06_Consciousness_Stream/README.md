# 🧠 06_Consciousness_Stream (Raw Thought Log)

## 📌 Overview
The **Inner Monologue**. This directory captures the unstructured, raw flow of thoughts, daily journals, and monthly reflections. It differs from `Archive` (which stores external interactions) by focusing on *internal* processing.

## 📝 Usage
*   **Daily Dumps**: Rapid fire brain-dumps to clear working memory.
*   **Monthly Reflections**: Structured reviews of progress, emotional state, and system alignment (e.g., `2026-01.md`).
*   **Idea incubation**: The "primordial soup" where new concepts are born before being structured into Modules.

## 🔒 Privacy Policy
**STATUS: LOCAL ONLY (PERSONAL)**
Contents are **git-ignored** for strict personal privacy.
*   This represents the system's "Self-Awareness" layer and is not shared.
