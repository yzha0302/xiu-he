# 📥 00_Inbox (Temporary Holding)

## 📌 Overview
The **Universal Catch-All** for incoming information. This is a temporary staging area for unsorted files, raw ideas, and downloaded assets before they are processed into specific knowledge modules.

## ⚙️ Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1.  **Capture**: Drop all new files/notes here immediately.
2.  **Process**: Use standard workflows (e.g., `/learn`, `/fact-check`) to structure materials.
3.  **Clear**: Move processed items to `02_Skill_Tree/Modules/` or `03_Inventory_Assets/`.
4.  **Review**: Aim for "Inbox Zero" weekly.

## 🔒 Privacy Policy
**STATUS: LOCAL ONLY**
Contents are **git-ignored** to prevent repo bloat and clutter.
*   Only this `README.md` is synced.
*   Actual temporary files reside locally.
