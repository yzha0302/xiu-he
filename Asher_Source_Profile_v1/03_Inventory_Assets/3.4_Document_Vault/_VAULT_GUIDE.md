*   *Good:* `2025-06-09_ASIC_CorporateKey_Letter.pdf`
*   *Good:* `2024-07-01_ATO_NoticeOfAssessment.pdf`
*   *Bad:* `scan_001.pdf`

## 🔍 How to Retrieve

Simply ask the AI:
> "Check my Document Vault for the ASIC key letter."
> "Find my passport details in the vault."

The AI will search the file names and read specific content only when requested.
